# `rpi` - rolimon's python interaction

`rpi` is an **open source** python-based **rolimon's api wrapper**. It
provides an end-to-end pipeline in which each component can
be easily modified or extended to develop new models. `rpi` also allows rolimon's api 
to be parsed with ease. `rpi` includes data extraction and interpretation models, provided by 
[rolimon's private api](http://rolimons.com).
